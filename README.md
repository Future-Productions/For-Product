#                The For Product Business Model

## Statement of Intent
Own land and trade future work to control essential goods and services without debt.

## Definitions
* Product Tickets represent expiring claim of ownership over future goods and services.
* Work Agreements represent legally binding commitments to achieve that future production.
* Source Titles represent property ownership in land, tools, water-rights, mineral-rights.

## Terms of Operation
* You may buy Product Tickets with money to receive that future good or service, just like crowdfunding.
* You may buy Product Tickets by signing Work Agreements to achieve some future production in the system.
* When paying with Work Agreements, you also receive Source Title ownership as that production is completed.
* As a Source Title owner, you may decide what must and must not be produced on that land.
* As a Source Title owner, you are the *automatic* owner of that future production.
* As a Source Title owner, you must *cover* the costs of that production.
* These terms must work when co-owing in groups and groups-of-groups*

## Pilot Project Startup Timeline
* Find raw land for sale outside of city limits to build a self-hosted micro-city.
* Verify which essential goods and services could be produced at this location.
* Issue Product Tickets representing those future goods and services.
* Auction those Product Tickets to secure the land and tools without debt.
* Issue Work Agreements representing commitments to achieve that production.
* Issue Source Titles representing small amounts of land ownership.
* Auction the Source Titles to secure Work Agreement signatures.
* If both auctions succeed, the land is purchased and production begins!
